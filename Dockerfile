# NIRIKSHAK — a container where PDF rendering works.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. WeasyPrint lays text out through Pango, which is part of the
# native GTK stack: DLLs and shared objects installed by a system package
# manager, not by pip. ADR 0006 fixed the renderer as WeasyPrint and forbade
# every fallback — no second engine, no headless browser, no HTML returned under
# a `.pdf` name — which leaves exactly one way to make the endpoint work, and it
# is this: install the runtime.
#
# It is not a workaround for a developer machine. It is the supported way to run
# NIRIKSHAK with every deliverable available, and it doubles as the reproducible
# setup a reviewer can check: the build either succeeds or it does not.
#
# OFFLINE-FIRST (Rule 6). The build needs a network; the running container does
# not. Nothing under `api/` fetches anything, no model is downloaded here, and
# the image carries no credentials. Run it with `--network none` once built and
# every endpoint except PDF-less ones still works.

# names. `libgobject-2.0` and `glib-2.0` both come from libglib2.0-0.
#
# `fonts-dejavu-core` is not optional. WeasyPrint with no font installed renders
# a PDF of the correct size containing nothing legible, which is worse than the
# 503 it replaces — a file that looks like a report and is blank.
