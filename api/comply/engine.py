"""The deterministic rule engine — the only thing in NIRIKSHAK that says PASS.

CLAUDE.md Rule 1 in code form. This module's inputs are a typed
`CanonicalSecurityModel` and a `Rulepack`, and there is no third parameter. Raw
configuration text and model output cannot reach a verdict because there is
nowhere for them to enter, which is asserted by import tests rather than trusted.

The verdict table, in full:

    CSM field state       policy consulted            verdict
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    PRESENT               —                           PASS / FAIL
    ABSENT_DEFAULT        on_absent_default           per policy
    ABSENT_UNSUPPORTED    on_absent_unsupported       per policy
    UNKNOWN               on_capability_unknown       UNKNOWN, always
    key absent            —                           UNKNOWN · no_match
    rule not applicable   —                           no finding at all

Two rules govern every row, and both are Rule 3 obligations:

**A verdict needs justification.** PASS and FAIL require the field's own evidence
or, for a documented default, the citation that default rests on. A field that is
PRESENT without evidence cannot exist — the `Field` contract forbids it — so this
is belt and braces, but the engine checks rather than assumes.

**An unanswerable question stays unanswered.** A condition that cannot be
evaluated against the value it was given abstains with `rule_type_mismatch`. It
never becomes FAIL, which is the tempting mistake: FAIL feels like the safe
direction for a security tool, and it is not. It is a claim about a device, made
without evidence, that an operator would spend time on.
