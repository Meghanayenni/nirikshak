"""The confirmation loop over HTTP — the API P13's training screen will consume.

**Every endpoint here is admin-only**, including the read. That is stricter than
the rest of the API, where a user sees what they uploaded, and it is deliberate:
the queue is fleet-wide by construction — one shape across thirty devices is one
decision worth thirty — so reading it means reading configuration lines from
files the caller may not own. And confirming is a higher privilege than anything
else in NIRIKSHAK: a confirmation changes how every future device of that
platform is parsed, permanently, for everyone.

**Two steps, never one** (D51). `/compile` produces a DRAFT and hands back the
generated regex; `/activate` is a separate call. CLAUDE.md §4 requires the pattern
be shown to the administrator and editable before activation, and an endpoint
that compiled-and-activated in one request would delete that review while
appearing to be a convenience.

**Suggestions are ranked, never scored as probabilities.** The payload carries
`rank`, the raw score, and `is_probability: false` — because a frontend given a
bare float will eventually render it as a percentage, and R7 exists to stop
exactly that. When no suggestion could be produced the payload says so with a
reason (D50); it never returns an empty list as though the model had run.
