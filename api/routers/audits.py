"""Compliance audits over HTTP — the first API the eventual UI will consume.

Mounted under `/compliance/` rather than `/audits`, deliberately. P2 already owns
`/audit/*` for the hash-chained audit LOG, which is read-only by design, and
`/audit/head` beside `/audits` would be two unrelated resources one character
apart. A test caught the collision; the names were the thing worth fixing.

Four endpoints, all authenticated (decision D25), all scoped to what the caller
owns unless they are an admin. Deliberately narrow: these are the shapes P8's
reporting layer needs, and P8 is the first real client. Anything speculative
waits for the phase that needs it, because an endpoint nobody exercises is an
endpoint designed against a guess.

The pipeline runs in-process — parse, normalise, evaluate, analyse — and the
result is **persisted** (decision D23), so a later request describes the audit
that ran rather than a fresh one that happens to agree with it.
