"""Finding — one rule evaluated against one device.

Produced only by the deterministic engine reading the Canonical Security Model
(CLAUDE.md Rule 1). Note what this contract does *not* have: no field accepts
model output, an explanation string that could carry a verdict, or a suggested
value. A model has nowhere to write here even if something tried.

A PASS or FAIL requires either evidence or an explicit absence citation, and an
UNKNOWN requires a stated reason. Abstention is a first-class result that
travels with its justification, not a gap in the report.
