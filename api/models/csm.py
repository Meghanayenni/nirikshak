"""The Canonical Security Model — the trust boundary.

Everything upstream of this object may deal in vendor syntax and model output.
Nothing downstream of it may. The compliance engine at P6 accepts a CSM and
nothing else, so there is no parameter through which raw configuration text or
a model suggestion could reach a verdict (CLAUDE.md Rule 1).

`fields` is an open mapping rather than a fixed set of attributes. Adding a
canonical field is then a data change in a vendor pack and a rule, not an edit
to this class — which is what Rule 5 and the problem statement's
no-code-redeployment clause require.

**Absence from this table is the safe answer**, not an oversight: every field not
named here is `UNDECIDED` and abstains on disagreement. Opting a field in is a
deliberate, reviewable act that changes what the field *asserts*, so it belongs
in a decision record and needs a fixture that exercises it.

`idle_timeout_seconds` is deliberately absent. Two vty ranges with different
timeouts are a real "which one did you mean" question, and the honest answer is
that the configuration does not say.

`snmp_v3_only` is deliberately absent too, though `WORST_CASE_FALSE` expresses
its semantics exactly — a v1/v2c community is dispositive. No pack declares an
SNMP pattern yet, so opting it in would be a claim nothing could exercise. It
belongs to the change that authors those patterns. See ADR 0026.
