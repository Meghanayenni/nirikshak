"""The Canonical Security Model — the trust boundary.

Everything upstream of this object may deal in vendor syntax and model output.
Nothing downstream of it may. The compliance engine at P6 accepts a CSM and
nothing else, so there is no parameter through which raw configuration text or
a model suggestion could reach a verdict (CLAUDE.md Rule 1).

`fields` is an open mapping rather than a fixed set of attributes. Adding a
canonical field is then a data change in a vendor pack and a rule, not an edit
to this class — which is what Rule 5 and the problem statement's
no-code-redeployment clause require.
