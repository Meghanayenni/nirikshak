"""Remediation snippets — the vetted library (CLAUDE.md Rule 4).

Commands come from here and nowhere else. There is no generation path in this
contract or in the resolver that reads it: a missing snippet yields nothing, not
an improvisation. A hallucinated command pasted into a production device is the
most damaging failure this system could produce, so the safe behaviour is
designed in rather than guarded against.

`vetted_by` is mandatory and non-empty. An unvetted snippet is not a snippet.
