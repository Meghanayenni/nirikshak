"""Field — value, confidence and evidence (CLAUDE.md Rules 2 and 3, decision R7).

Three guarantees are enforced here, at construction, so that violating them is
not merely discouraged but impossible:

**Evidence is mandatory.** A field claiming PRESENT without evidence cannot be
built. The check consults only `state` and `evidence` — never `confidence` — so
a high score can never stand in for a missing citation. Confidence and evidence
are separate semantics that happen to travel together (R7).

**Low confidence abstains.** Below the configured threshold, state is coerced to
UNKNOWN before invariants are checked. Coercion lives in the model rather than
at the call site, so a caller cannot forget it.

**Uncalibrated similarity cannot assert anything.** A raw similarity score is
not a confidence. A field whose method is `uncalibrated_similarity` is forced to
UNKNOWN whatever its numeric value, because no mapping from that score to an
observed accuracy has been established yet. The score is still recorded, so an
administrator can see it in the training queue — it simply cannot support a
claim.
