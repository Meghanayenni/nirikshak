"""Vendor packs — how one platform's syntax maps to the canonical model.

Rule 5: packs are data. Adding a vendor is a configuration change, not a code
release. That is the clause the problem statement is really testing, so this
contract is what makes it true or false.

Patterns are deliberately boring (CLAUDE.md §4). The compiler at P11 tokenises a
confirmed line, substitutes the captured token, escapes the rest and anchors it
— predictable enough that an administrator who does not write regular
expressions can still read one and see that it is right.
