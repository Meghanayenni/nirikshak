"""NIRIKSHAK data contracts.

The eleven contracts, defined before any logic that uses them (CLAUDE.md §14).
Everything the system claims is expressed in these types, and the guarantees
that matter are enforced by their validators rather than by the code that
happens to call them:

  * A PRESENT field without evidence cannot be constructed        (Rule 2)
  * Sub-threshold confidence becomes UNKNOWN at construction      (Rule 3)
  * Uncalibrated similarity cannot support any claim              (R7)
  * A PASS/FAIL finding without justification cannot be built     (Rule 2)
  * A snippet without a vetter cannot be built                    (Rule 4)
  * An audit record whose hash disagrees with its payload raises
  * A rule carrying framework prose is rejected by extra="forbid" (R16)

`FieldMatch` and `ParseResult` (P4) sit alongside the eleven rather than among
them: they are the parse layer's own carriers, not claims the whole system is
built on. They live here because `api/models/` is the one package every layer
may import, which is what keeps the parser from having to be imported to read
what it produced.
