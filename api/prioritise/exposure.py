"""Exposure-aware prioritisation, and its refusal to guess.

The Concept Report states the goal in one sentence:

> Severity alone is a poor ranking. A weak cipher on a management interface
> reachable from a user VLAN is not the same risk as the same cipher behind a
> deny-all ACL. Reasoning over the canonical model together with parsed ACLs
> turns a flat findings list into an ordered remediation queue.

Read it carefully and it names its own inputs: **the canonical model together
with parsed ACLs**. Exposure is a claim about where a control lives and who can
reach it, so it needs interfaces to say where, and access lists to say who.

`CanonicalSecurityModel.interfaces` and `.acls` are both empty on every device in
this corpus, and empty by construction rather than by accident — no pack declares
an interface or ACL pattern, because no corpus file contains an access list at
all (SOURCING_BACKLOG gaps 1 and 5). So on this repository every assessment this
module produces is **UNDETERMINED**, and that is the correct answer rather than a
limitation being worked around.

**The alternative was available and is worse.** Ranking by `base_severity` alone
would produce a plausible ordered list that an operator could act on, and
CLAUDE.md §7 forbids exactly that: *"Severity alone must not determine
remediation order."* A ranking that claims to be exposure-aware while being
severity sorted is not a partial implementation of this feature; it is a
different feature wearing its name.

So `exposure_score` stays `None`, `priority_rank` stays `None`, and the layer
reports which input was missing. The machinery is real, tested against
constructed models, and will produce numbers the day an ACL-bearing configuration
is sourced — the same shape P7 took for ACL analysis and P8 for remediation.
