"""Turning a flat findings list into an ordered remediation queue — or refusing to.

This is the "Prioritise" stage of the pipeline the Concept Report names:

    Ingest -> Parse -> Normalise -> Comply -> Prioritise -> Remediate -> Report

and it is the stage that has been a stub since P6, with `exposure_score` and
`priority_rank` sitting on `Finding` as `None` through five phases.

**P12 does not fill them in on this corpus, and that is the finding.** Exposure
needs interfaces and access lists; the corpus has neither, on any device, in any
split. So `prioritise()` assesses every finding, finds every assessment
undetermined, and returns a result that says so — carrying the *reason* per
finding rather than a rank nobody could justify.

The temptation this module exists to refuse is a one-line severity sort. It would
produce an ordered list an operator could act on, it would look exactly like the
feature, and CLAUDE.md §7 forbids it in as many words: *"Severity alone must not
determine remediation order."* A severity sort presented as exposure-aware
prioritisation would not be a partial implementation — it would be a claim that
reachability had been considered when nothing had been read that could establish
it.

So the ranking is *conditional*, and the condition is checked rather than
assumed: findings are ranked only when their exposure was determined, and the
result reports how many were not.
