"""Producing up to three ranked candidates for an unknown line.

This is the module the whole Rule 1 argument points at, so it is worth being
precise about what it does and does not do.

**It proposes. It never decides.** Every `Suggestion` leaves here carrying
`ConfidenceMethod.UNCALIBRATED_SIMILARITY`, which the contract already treats as
forcing the field to UNKNOWN regardless of the number attached — a raw score may
be *recorded and shown*, and can never support a claim. Nothing downstream can
promote it: `normalise` may not import `learn`, so a suggestion has no path into
the canonical model, and `comply` may not import `learn`, so it has no path into
a verdict. Coverage grows one way only:

    administrator confirms -> pattern enters the pack -> re-parse -> DETERMINISTIC match

**It ships uncalibrated, deliberately** (decision D42). Marking these
`CALIBRATED_SIMILARITY` would require a calibrator fitted on labelled ground
truth that does not exist, and the contract refuses a calibrated method without a
calibrated value. The abstention that follows is not a limitation being worked
around; it is the correct answer until the data exists.
