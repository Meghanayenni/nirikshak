"""Token-shape signatures, for clustering unknown lines.

`UnknownLine.normalised_line` has been an empty string since P5, where
`api/normalise/residue.py` left it with the note *"token-shape signature is
P10's clustering concern"*. This is that concern.

A signature replaces the parts of a line that vary between devices with typed
placeholders and keeps everything else exactly as written:

    ntp server 192.0.2.20        ->  ntp server <IP>
    ntp server 192.0.2.21        ->  ntp server <IP>
    exec-timeout 10 0            ->  exec-timeout <N> <N>
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0 ->  interface <WORD>

Two lines with the same signature are the same *command* on different values,
which is what makes clustering meaningful: an administrator confirming
`ntp server <IP>` confirms it for every device in the fleet at once.

**The signatures are deliberately boring.** CLAUDE.md §4 requires generated
patterns be predictable enough that an administrator can read and verify them,
and the signature is what they will be shown next to the line. A clever
normaliser that collapsed more would produce clusters nobody could check.

This module is pure string handling. It imports nothing from `api/` and no
machine-learning library, so clustering works with the `[ai]` extra uninstalled.
