"""The confirmation loop, end to end.

    residue -> queue -> a human decides -> compile -> DRAFT -> VALIDATED
            -> activate -> re-parse -> the line is no longer unknown

This module is the only place those steps meet. `api/learn/` proposes and knows
nothing about storage; `api/db/` stores and knows nothing about clustering;
`api/ingest/` loads packs and knows nothing about training. Composing them is a
job, and giving it a package of its own is what let decision D44 keep
`learn -> db` forbidden — the advisory branch still cannot write anything.

**Every mutation is audited before it is useful.** A confirmation appends
`ADMIN_CONFIRMED` or `ADMIN_CORRECTED`; compiling appends `PACK_CREATED`;
activation appends `PACK_ACTIVATED`; rollback appends `PACK_ROLLED_BACK`. Those
five actions have existed in the enum since P1 and were emitted by nothing until
now.

**No configuration content enters the audit chain** (decision D4). The payloads
here carry identifiers, field names, versions, digests and counts — which line
was confirmed is answerable from the operational store, where configuration-
derived data belongs. The chain attests that a mapping was confirmed, by whom,
for which field; it does not quote the device.
