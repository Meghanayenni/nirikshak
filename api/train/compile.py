"""Turning one confirmed line into one vendor-pack pattern.

This is the module CLAUDE.md §4 is about, and the rule it states is a constraint
on *style*, not only on correctness:

> Generated patterns must be predictable and boring: tokenise the confirmed line,
> replace the captured token with `(\\S+)`, escape the rest, anchor with `^`, show
> it to the administrator, allow editing before activation.
>
> Do not generate clever regexes. A pattern an administrator cannot read is one
> they cannot verify.

So the compiler here is deliberately unambitious. It does not infer alternation,
it does not detect optional tokens, it does not merge two confirmations into one
general pattern, and it never guesses which token carries the value — the
administrator says which one, because they are the only party who knows whether
`2` in `ip ssh version 2` is the value or part of the command name.

**Nothing enters a pattern that a human did not confirm.** `compile_pattern`
takes a `TrainingExample` — a recorded decision with a named `confirmed_by` — and
refuses a bare `Suggestion`. That refusal is the learning loop's entire safety
argument in one function signature.

**Scope defaults to the literal header** (ADR 0011). A line confirmed inside
`line vty 0 4` compiles to a scope matching that block and no other. Generalising
to a numeric range is an explicit opt-in the administrator makes and sees,
because loose scoping is how a console timeout ends up reported as a management
idle timeout (decision D9).
