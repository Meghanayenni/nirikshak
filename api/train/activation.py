"""The pack lifecycle: DRAFT -> VALIDATED -> ACTIVE, and back again.

Decision D51. Compiling a pattern and *trusting* it are two different acts, and
P11 keeps them two different calls. The gap between them is where CLAUDE.md §4's
"show it to the administrator, allow editing before activation" lives, and where
P13 will eventually render the generated regex for review. Collapsing the two
into one convenient call would foreclose that, and would mean a pattern entered a
vendor pack in the same breath as it was proposed.

**Reviewed data is never mutated at runtime.** `packs/builtin/` holds packs a
person wrote and a reviewer read; a deployment that edited those files would make
`git status` dirty, invalidate their checksums, and destroy the one clean answer
to "what did we ship". So activation never touches them. Instead the trained root
carries an *activation record* — `activation.yaml` — which names the version this
deployment has chosen for each platform:

    a pack file's `status:` is what it SHIPPED as
    the activation record is what this deployment has since decided

Exactly one of the two answers is authoritative per platform, and the record wins
where it has an opinion. That keeps decision D46's "one ACTIVE pack per platform"
true without a second copy of any pack and without editing a reviewed file.

**Rollback is the same mechanism run backwards** (`PACK_ROLLED_BACK`). Pointing
the record at the previous version restores the previous parse behaviour exactly,
because the previous pack file was never modified — which is the practical payoff
of refusing to mutate anything.
