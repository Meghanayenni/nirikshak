"""The training queue: what an administrator is actually asked to decide.

Residue in, one decision at a time out. The clustering, ranking and index all
belong to `api/learn/`; what this module adds is the honesty layer between them
and a person.

**The central rule here is decision D50.** On a machine where the embedding model
is absent — which is every machine in this repository, because the `[ai]` extra
is deliberately uninstalled (ADR 0018) — the queue must still work, and it must
say *why* there are no suggestions. It must never return an empty list of
suggestions, because an empty list is indistinguishable from "the model ran and
found nothing similar", and those are opposite statements. One means *we could
not look*; the other means *we looked and the index is unlike this line*. An
administrator who cannot tell them apart is being asked to confirm a mapping
while being misled about what informed the question.

This is the same failure CLAUDE.md §14 names — *"a mode that silently returns
empty output is indistinguishable from a clean result"* — applied to the one
screen where a mistake becomes permanent.

So a `QueueEntry` never carries a bare tuple of suggestions. It carries a
`SuggestionOutcome` with an explicit state, and the state is what the interface
renders. Confirming with no suggestion at all remains perfectly valid: the
administrator is the authority and always was, and a confirmation made without a
ranking is the `CORRECTED` path the contract has modelled since P1.
