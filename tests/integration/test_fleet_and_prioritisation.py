"""The Prioritise stage over HTTP, on the real corpus (P12).

Everything asserted here is a **refusal**, and that is the point of the file.
The corpus contains no access list and no interface on any device in any split,
and its largest cohort holds four devices against a floor of five. So:

  * no finding gets an exposure score;
  * no finding gets a priority rank;
  * no cohort produces a baseline;
  * no device is called an outlier.

A test suite that could not tell that state apart from a working ranking would be
the real failure, so each assertion below checks that the *reason* travelled with
the refusal.

Two defect fixes are also verified here, both discovered outside their own phase:
DEF-14 (the audit chain never recorded that an audit ran) and DEF-15 (the
detected device identity never reached the canonical model).

The PAN-OS holdout is not uploaded, opened or named.
