"""Architecture tests for the Prioritise stage (P12).

Prioritisation sits between the engine that decides and the report that renders,
and it is the layer most likely to acquire a shortcut: ranking is easy to fake,
and a fake ranking is indistinguishable from a real one at a glance.

So the guards here are less about imports than about *claims*. The important
ones assert that this layer cannot produce a score it did not establish, cannot
reach a verdict, and cannot fall back to sorting by severity.
