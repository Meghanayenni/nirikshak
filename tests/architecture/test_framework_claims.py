"""No document in this repository may claim coverage it cannot source.

Three frameworks of four are sourced: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 as OSCAL (ADR 0035),
and the DISA Cisco IOS XE Router NDM STIG and the CIS Cisco IOS XE 17.x
Benchmark, both obtained by hand (ADR 0052). ISO/IEC 27001 is purchased and is
not.

**The temptation to round that up is the single largest risk to this project's
integrity argument.** Everything NIRIKSHAK claims rests on refusing to state
more than it can show — the abstentions, the disclosures, the empty selector,
the `project_asserted` provenance on every mapping. One sentence in a README
saying "CIS, NIST, STIG and ISO" undoes all of it, because a reader who checks
one claim and finds it inflated has no reason to believe the rest.

`tests/architecture/test_architecture_document.py` guards one file. This guards
every prose document in the repository, and does it by asking the code which
frameworks are sourced rather than by holding a list of its own.
