"""No document in this repository may claim coverage it cannot source.

One framework of four is sourced. NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 was obtained as OSCAL and
every mapping is validated against it; CIS Benchmarks are behind registration,
DISA's STIG index serves no resolvable file URL, and ISO/IEC 27001 is purchased
(ADR 0035).

**The temptation to round that up is the single largest risk to this project's
integrity argument.** Everything NIRIKSHAK claims rests on refusing to state
more than it can show — the abstentions, the disclosures, the empty selector,
the `project_asserted` provenance on every mapping. One sentence in a README
saying "CIS, NIST, STIG and ISO" undoes all of it, because a reader who checks
one claim and finds it inflated has no reason to believe the rest.

`tests/architecture/test_architecture_document.py` guards one file. This guards
every prose document in the repository, and does it by asking the code which
frameworks are sourced rather than by holding a list of its own.
