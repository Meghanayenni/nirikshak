"""Boundaries around remediation (P8).

Rule 4 is the clause with the sharpest failure mode in the whole project: a
model-generated command, pasted into a production device on NIRIKSHAK's
authority. The defence is structural rather than procedural, and this is where it
is asserted.

Three properties, in descending order of how much they matter:

    1. `api/remediate/` cannot reach a model. No ML library, no LLM client, no
       `api.learn`.
    2. Nothing in the package composes a command. Commands are read from YAML
       under `snippets/` and returned unchanged.
    3. The package carries no verdict vocabulary, so remediation cannot become a
       second place where something resembling a compliance decision is made.

The `comply -> remediate` edge is asserted in `test_import_rules.py` alongside
the rest of the module graph; it is the reason `Finding.remediation` is `None`
everywhere and resolution happens downstream.
