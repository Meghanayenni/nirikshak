"""Repository content policy test for R16.

Ratified decision R16 takes the conservative engineering approach to framework
content: the repository stores framework and control *identifiers*, our own rule
metadata, and rationale text we wrote. It does not accumulate large amounts of
framework prose.

This test enforces that policy mechanically. It makes no legal claim of any
kind; it simply keeps the repository's content to what we can account for.
See docs/CONTENT_POLICY.md.

Passes vacuously until rulepacks are authored at P6.
