"""Architecture test for R1: NIRIKSHAK is configuration-file-only.

The Concept Report and CLAUDE.md §9 both forbid live device access, network
scanning and credentialed connections. Ratified decision R1 removed Netmiko and
NAPALM from the dependency set entirely, so the guarantee is enforced by what is
*absent* rather than by what the code chooses not to call.

Two independent checks, because a rule with real-world consequences should not
depend on a single mechanism:

  1. No source file under api/ imports a device-connection library.
  2. No such library is present in the resolved environment at all.

The second is the stronger claim: a library that is not installed cannot be
called by any future contributor in a hurry.
