"""A field the input cannot carry is not a field nobody parsed.

`DeviceIdentity.serial` is `None` on every device NIRIKSHAK has read, and until
P18 the repository filed that beside its parsing gaps. It is not one: a serial
appears in `show version` and `show inventory` output, not in a configuration
export, so no pattern over this input could ever match.

The distinction matters because the two have different fixes. A parsing gap is
closed by authoring a pattern. This is closed by accepting a second input type,
and until somebody does, a `serial` pattern would be a regex in a pack that no
input can satisfy — the failure CLAUDE.md §3 names directly.
