"""Every shipped framework mapping names a real control in a real edition.

This module replaces `test_no_framework_mappings_are_claimed`, which asserted
that **zero** control identifiers ship and was written to be deleted by whoever
sourced the first one. It was deleted by the commit that added these (ADR 0035).

The gate it enforced has not been relaxed, only moved. Before, the rule was *no
identifier may be written without reading the benchmark*. Now it is *every
identifier must exist in a catalog whose bytes are content-addressed, and no
mapping may call itself official*.
