/**
 * NIRIKSHAK design tokens — light theme.
 *
 * These are the values from `docs/ui_reference.html` §1, which is the visual
 * specification for this interface, and they match CLAUDE.md §10 exactly. The
 * reference is never read at runtime and never modified; it is translated.
 *
 * The principles these tokens exist to serve, from §10:
 *
 *   - Semantic colour appears ONLY on verdict chips, the inferred marker, the
 *     evidence highlight and focus states. Never on table rows, never as a large
 *     fill. If a screen is more than roughly a tenth colour, something is being
 *     decorated rather than communicated.
 *
 *   - Colour accelerates recognition; it never carries meaning alone. Reports
 *     print in greyscale and a meaningful share of engineers have colour vision
 *     deficiency, so every state pairs its colour with a text label and a
 *     distinct weight or border treatment.
 *
 *   - FAIL is heaviest — solid fill, reversed text — and draws the eye first.
 *     PASS is lightest: a compliant control needs no attention.
 *
 *   - UNKNOWN is dashed and neutral slate, deliberately NOT amber. Abstention
 *     sits off the severity axis, not at the bottom of it. If the interface made
 *     abstention look like a weaker failure, operators would learn to filter it
 *     out and Rule 3 would be defeated at the presentation layer.
 *
 *   - Severity uses ink weight, not colour. Two competing colour scales on one
 *     screen produce a rainbow and destroy the verdict signal.
