/**
 * Creating, editing and retiring a human-verified mapping.
 *
 * Every one of these composes endpoints that already existed for the residue
 * workflow. Nothing here is a shortcut around that workflow — in particular the
 * **two-step review is preserved** (decision D51, CLAUDE.md §4):
 *
 *     describe  ->  compile  ->  READ THE REGEX  ->  activate
 *
 * `compile` returns a DRAFT and the generated pattern; `activate` is a separate
 * call the administrator makes after looking at it. Collapsing them into one
 * convenient function would delete the review while appearing to be a
 * convenience, so this module deliberately exposes them as two.
 *
 * **Editing is withdraw-then-create, not an in-place rewrite.** A pattern is
 * never mutated where it stands: the version holding the old mapping stays on
 * disk so an audit run under it remains explainable, and the new mapping is a
 * fresh decision by a named person at a known moment. That is also why an edit
 * re-runs `confirm` rather than reusing the old example — the administrator is
 * deciding again, and the record should say so.
