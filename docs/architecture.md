# NIRIKSHAK — Architecture

Self-learning, vendor-agnostic network security compliance auditor.
Smart India Hackathon 2026 · Problem Statement 26155 · NTRO · Team Atlantis.

This document describes the system **as it stands at P14**, not as it was
planned. Where a capability is built but has no data to run on, that is stated
here as plainly as the capability itself — because on this build the difference
between *"the check passed"* and *"the check could not be made"* is most of what
NIRIKSHAK is for.

The specification is `docs/NIRIKSHAK_Concept_Report.pdf`. The permanent
implementation constraints are in `CLAUDE.md`. The reasoning behind individual
choices is in `docs/adr/`; this document is the map, not the argument.

---

## 1. What the system does, in one paragraph

NIRIKSHAK reads network device configuration files that were exported offline,
normalises vendor-specific syntax into a vendor-neutral security schema,
evaluates that schema against declarative compliance rules with a deterministic
engine, and produces findings that each cite the exact configuration line they
rest on. When it meets a line no vendor pack recognises, it does not guess: it
asks an administrator, and compiles their confirmed answer into a versioned
vendor pack so the next parse recognises it deterministically.

**AI suggests. Rules decide.**

---

## 2. The pipeline

The deterministic spine does all the work that produces a verdict:

```
  Ingest  ->  Parse  ->  Normalise  ->  Comply  ->  Prioritise  ->  Remediate  ->  Report
     |          |            |            |             |              |             |
  detect     ConfigTree     CSM        Finding      exposure       snippet        HTML
  vendor,    + residue   (typed,      (PASS/FAIL/   (abstains      lookup       document
  hash,      per pack    evidence-     UNKNOWN/     without ACL    (library     with cited
  store                  bearing)      N/A)         + interface    is empty)      lines
                             |                       data)
                             |
                        residue (lines no pack matched)
                             |
                             v
              +----------------------------------+
              |   ADVISORY BRANCH — not a verdict |
              |                                    |
              |   learn   cluster, embed, rank     |
              |     |     top-3 candidate fields   |
              |     v                              |
              |   HUMAN   administrator confirms   |
              |     |     or corrects              |
              |     v                              |
              |   train   compile -> DRAFT ->      |
              |           VALIDATED -> ACTIVE      |
              +----------------------------------+
                             |
                    a new vendor pack version
                             |
                             v
                    re-parse: the line is now
                    matched DETERMINISTICALLY
```

**The advisory branch is beside the pipeline, never inside it.** `api/learn/`
produces `Suggestion` objects that carry no value — only a proposed *meaning* for
a line — and every one leaves the package marked `UNCALIBRATED_SIMILARITY`, which
the contract treats as forcing the field to UNKNOWN regardless of the number
attached. A suggestion reaches a verdict by exactly one route: a human confirms
it, it becomes pack **data**, and the deterministic parser matches it on the next
run.

That is a structural property, not a convention. `comply` may not import `learn`
or `train`; `normalise` may not import `learn` or `train`; a `Suggestion` has no
`value` field to promote. See §5.

---

## 3. The six rules, and where each is enforced

CLAUDE.md states six non-negotiable rules. Each is enforced by a test or a
contract, not by intention.

| Rule | Enforced by |
| --- | --- |
| **1. AI never issues a compliance verdict** | 75 forbidden import edges in `tests/architecture/test_import_rules.py`, of which `comply -> learn`, `comply -> train`, `normalise -> learn`, `normalise -> train` and `report -> learn` carry the weight. Plus: `Suggestion` has no `value` field; `assert_never_confidence()` raises at the package boundary; the audit database has `CHECK (actor_type <> 'model' OR action = 'ai_suggested')` below Python. |
| **2. Evidence is mandatory** | `Field` construction. A PRESENT field without evidence cannot be built. Comment prefixes and literal blocks never become parse nodes, so a commented-out directive cannot produce a PRESENT field. |
| **3. Low confidence abstains** | The `ConfidenceMethod` split. Populations are floored separately: `deterministic` and `admin_confirmed` are exactly 1.0 or nothing; `platform_default` has its own floor and is always marked INFERRED; only `calibrated_similarity` is compared against `confidence_threshold`. `UNCALIBRATED_SIMILARITY` forces UNKNOWN whatever the score. |
| **4. Remediation is never AI-generated** | `remediate -> learn`, `remediate -> train` and `prioritise -> remediate` are forbidden edges. Commands are read from `snippets/` and never synthesised. `RemediationSnippet` requires `vetted_by` and `reference`, and a content-policy test refuses a vetter whose name looks automated. |
| **5. Rules and vendor packs are data** | `packs/` and `rules/` are YAML. A new pack version is written at runtime by `api/train/` and activated without a restart — `clear_pack_cache()` makes the next parse use it in the same process. |
| **6. Offline-first** | No device library may be imported (`tests/architecture/test_no_device_libraries.py`). No network client in `ingest`, `parse`, `learn`, `train` or `prioritise`. Secrets are scrubbed before any text reaches an embedding model. `settings.airgap` makes the model loader fail closed rather than fetch. |

---

## 4. Packages and responsibilities

Fifteen packages under `api/`, 109 modules.

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `models/` | The typed contracts everything else speaks. A **leaf**: it may import nothing else from `api/`, so no forbidden edge can be satisfied transitively through it. |
| `security/` | Password hashing (scrypt) and secret scrubbing before inference. |
| `db/` | SQLite connections, forward-only checksum-verified migrations, and the row-level stores. |
| `audit/` | The append-only hash chain: append, read, verify. Records events; never judges them. |
| `ingest/` | Upload, validation, format and vendor detection, line hashing and the fleet line cache, device identity extraction, vendor-pack loading and checksum verification. |
| `parse/` | Text to `ConfigTree`; applies a pack's patterns to produce `FieldMatch` objects and the **residue** — every node no pattern matched. |
| `normalise/` | `ParseResult` to `CanonicalSecurityModel`. Decides what an **absent** directive means, and scrubs residue for the training queue. |
| `comply/` | The deterministic rule engine. Reads the canonical model and nothing else; emits `Finding` objects. |
| `analyse/` | Semantic ACL analysis by interval logic — shadowed, redundant, overly permissive. Observations, not verdicts. |
| `prioritise/` | Exposure assessment and peer baselines. Ranks findings when exposure can be determined, and abstains when it cannot. |
| `remediate/` | Resolves a vetted snippet for a failing finding, or states that none exists. |
| `report/` | Renders a persisted run as a self-contained HTML document with its own disclosures. |
| `learn/` | The advisory branch: token-shape clustering, the labelled-example index, embedding adapter, top-3 retrieval, calibration machinery. Proposes; never decides. |
| `train/` | The confirmation loop: queue, pattern compiler, pack lifecycle, and the audit records for each. The only package permitted to compose `learn` with storage. |
| `routers/` | The HTTP surface. Performs the I/O and the authorisation checks; the layers below stay free of both. |

### Forbidden boundaries

**75 forbidden import edges**, asserted by `tests/architecture/test_import_rules.py`,
distributed by source package:

```
  analyse 8 · audit 3 · comply 9 · ingest 6 · learn 8 · normalise 6
  parse 6 · prioritise 10 · remediate 8 · report 7 · train 4
```

The shape of the argument is always the same: **a layer that decides must not be
able to see the layer that suggests, and a layer that suggests must not be able to
reach the layer that decides.** `comply` cannot import `parse` (no vendor syntax
reaches a verdict), `learn` cannot import `db` (the advisory branch cannot
persist), `prioritise` cannot import `comply` (a ranking layer that could see
verdict logic could start disagreeing with it), and `analyse` may import
`api.models` and nothing else.

Fourteen further architecture test files guard the same properties from other
angles: no ML library outside `learn`, no network capability, no vendor literal
in a vendor-neutral layer, no raw configuration line in the training queue, and
no path from the evaluation harness into any pipeline package.

---

## 5. One audit, end to end

A single request, `POST /compliance/audits?file_id=...`, traverses the whole
spine. Each arrow is a typed contract.

1. **Read** — the stored blob is fetched by its content hash.
2. **Parse** — `parse_configuration(text, pack)` builds a `ConfigTree`, applies
   the pack's patterns, and returns a `ParseResult` carrying `fields`, the
   `pack_version` that actually read them, and `residue`.
3. **Identity** — `extract_identity()` reads hostname, model, OS version and
   serial from the raw lines using the pack's `identity` patterns.
4. **Normalise** — `build_csm()` resolves what every **absent** field means:
   the platform's documented default, a control the platform cannot express, or
   an honest UNKNOWN. It emits a `CanonicalSecurityModel`.
5. **Evaluate** — `evaluate_device(csm, rulepack)` produces one `Finding` per
   applicable rule: PASS, FAIL, UNKNOWN or NOT_APPLICABLE, each carrying the
   evidence it rests on or the reason it abstained.
6. **Analyse** — `analyse_device(csm)` runs ACL interval logic on a separate
   rail from findings.
7. **Prioritise** — `prioritise(csm, findings, rulepack)` assesses exposure per
   finding and ranks only what it could determine.
8. **Persist** — the run and its findings are written to the operational store.
9. **Queue** — residue is recorded as the durable training queue, replacing that
   file's previous entries.
10. **Attest** — an `AUDIT_RUN` record is appended to the hash chain: counts,
    identifiers and versions only.
11. **Report** — `report.html` is regenerated from the persisted run on request,
    never stored as a second copy that could drift.

Every finding carries a `FindingProvenance`: engine version, rulepack version and
the vendor pack versions that read the lines. A verdict is reproducible only if
the data that produced it is identified.

---

## 6. Two databases, deliberately separate

```
  operational store              audit store
  ------------------             -----------
  config_file, config_line       audit_log
  line_cache, device             audit_chain_head
  ingestion, app_user            schema_migrations
  audit_run, finding
  finding_evidence
  unknown_line, training_example
```

**The operational store holds configuration-derived content. The audit store
holds attestations about it, and nothing else** (decision D4). The chain records
*that* an audit ran, over which device, with which rulepack and how many findings
of each verdict — never a value, never a raw line. Keeping them in separate files
makes that claim checkable by opening one.

`audit_log` is append-only, enforced by database triggers rather than by
convention. Each record binds the hash of its payload to the hash of the record
before it, so a retroactive edit anywhere breaks verification everywhere after.
`audit_chain_head` is a singleton that detects deletion of the chain's tail, which
the links alone cannot.

**The chain is tamper-evident, not tamper-proof.** It detects record
modification, deletion, reordering, broken links and accidental corruption. It
does *not* detect an attacker with unrestricted database write access who
recomputes the complete unkeyed chain (ADR 0008).

Evidence is stored as **pointers**, not copies: `(file_id, line_number)` resolves
through `config_line` and `line_cache` to the exact stored text, so a report
quotes the operator's own file rather than a transcription that could drift.

---

## 7. What NIRIKSHAK does not currently claim

This section is the most important one in the document. Every item is a
capability that is **built and tested** but has no data to run on. The machinery
is real; the output is an honest refusal.

| Not claimed | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Coverage against CIS, NIST SP 800-53, DISA STIG or ISO/IEC 27001** | Every rule ships an empty framework list. Writing an identifier without having read the benchmark would be inventing it. |
| **Any remediation command** | The vetted snippet library is empty. A snippet cannot exist without a person who read a vendor document and checked the commands, their rollback and their service impact against it. |
| **Absence-aware evaluation accuracy** | No platform default and no capability claim ships, so the `EVALUATE` branch has never fired on real data. |
| **ACL detection rates** | The corpus contains no access list in any split. The analyser has never seen a parsed one. |
| **Exposure scores or a priority ranking** | Exposure needs interfaces and access lists; the corpus has zero of both. Severity alone must not determine remediation order, so no severity-sorted list is offered in their place. |
| **Peer-baseline outliers** | Every cohort is below the minimum size of five, so no baseline is established and no device is called an outlier. |
| **Held-out generalisation** | Blocked: the metric is defined over the held-out vendor's commands, reading them needs an XML parser, and that parser waits on a sample independent of the holdout. |
| **Top-3 mapping accuracy or a calibrated confidence** | No line-level ground truth exists, and no calibrator is fitted. Every similarity score is a ranking, never a probability. |
| **Real-world accuracy** | Every corpus file is hand-written by one author. The harness measures a synthetic sample honestly; that is not field accuracy. |
| **Independent ground truth** | The labels are unreviewed, and the Cisco labels share an author with the Cisco parsing patterns. |

All ten trace to the eight entries in `docs/SOURCING_BACKLOG.md`:

1. ACL-bearing configurations
2. Vendor capability and default documentation
3. XML samples that do not compromise the PAN-OS holdout
4. Framework control-ID sources
5. Broader vendor and configuration diversity
6. Vendor remediation documentation
7. Line-level ground truth for the similarity layer
8. A corpus written by more than one author

**None can be closed by writing code**, and none may be closed by inventing data.

---

## 8. The sealed holdout

One vendor — **PAN-OS** — is held out entirely for the generalisation experiment.
Two files under `corpus/holdout/panos/` are recorded in `corpus/MANIFEST.yaml`
with `split: holdout`.

**They have never been opened.** Not read, not hashed, not parsed, at any point
in any phase. The seal is structural rather than procedural:

- The evaluation harness raises before a file handle is opened for a held-out
  split.
- PAN-OS has no active vendor pack, and `build_tree(..., mode=XML)` raises
  `UnsupportedSyntaxModeError` rather than returning an empty tree — so a
  held-out file cannot enter the pipeline even by accident.
- Architecture tests scan `api/learn/`, `api/train/` and `api/prioritise/` for the
  path fragments `holdout/`, `corpus/holdout`, `panos` and `paloalto`, with
  docstrings stripped first: explaining the rule is expected, constructing a path
  is not.
- Tests that must reason about splits skip holdout manifest entries **before any
  read**, and a helper that would receive one asserts against it.

The reason is single-use: once those files have been studied to build a parser,
top-3 accuracy on them measures memory rather than generalisation. The experiment
can be run once, and it has not been spent.

## 9. Defect register

Fifteen numbered defects. **Two are open.**

| # | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DEF-1 | Two distinct classes both named `DeviceIdentity`; an ambiguous import returned the wrong one | Fixed (ADR 0012) |
| DEF-2 | `management_interfaces()` folded undocumented status into "not management" | Fixed (ADR 0012) |
| **DEF-3** | **`device_id` is the configuration file's content hash, so it identifies *this configuration* rather than the physical device across time** | **OPEN** |
| DEF-4 | `on_capability_unknown` was configurable and could have turned every abstention into a pass | Fixed (ADR 0013) |
| DEF-5 | README misattributed exposure prioritisation to P7 | Fixed (ADR 0014) |
| DEF-6 | Evaluation harness defect | Fixed (ADR 0016) |
| DEF-7 | FAIL precision and recall undefined for the class that matters most | Closed by D32 (ADR 0016) |
| **DEF-8** | **`NRK-TIMEOUT-001` passes `exec-timeout 0 0` — a session that never expires is reported as compliant** | **OPEN** |
| DEF-9 | Arista pack did not declare `!` as a comment prefix; 23 of 57 residue lines were comments | Fixed (ADR 0017) |
| DEF-10 | Field provenance hard-coded `BUILTIN`, so a learned mapping would claim to be vendor-shipped | Fixed (ADR 0019) |
| DEF-11 | Pack versions ordered by string comparison; `1.0.10` sorted below `1.0.9` | Fixed (ADR 0020) |
| DEF-12 | `packs/trained/` was defined and read by nothing | Fixed (ADR 0019, 0020) |
| DEF-13 | Pack checksums were declared and never verified against file bytes | Fixed (ADR 0020) |
| DEF-14 | `POST /compliance/audits` never appended `AUDIT_RUN` to the chain | Fixed (ADR 0021) |
| DEF-15 | Detected device identity never reached the canonical model in the live pipeline | Fixed (ADR 0021) |

### Why the two open defects remain open

**DEF-3** — fixing it means redefining `device_id`, which every `Finding`, every
`audit_run` row, every report and the P9 evaluation already carry. Changing it
would move a measurement, and no phase since P5 has been the right place to do
that. P12 examined whether peer baselines needed it and found they do not: the
comparison is cross-sectional (*forty-seven switches now, three switches now*),
not longitudinal. The real consequence is recorded rather than hidden — **a
configuration re-uploaded after an edit counts as a second device** in its cohort.
Nothing anywhere presents a content hash as a stable device identity: the report
names its field `config_file_id`, and the interface labels devices by hostname.

**DEF-8** — the correct check is "at most 600 seconds **and** greater than zero",
and `CheckSpec` examines one field with one operator from a closed set. `lte`
cannot express it. Fixing it needs either a new `ConditionOp` or a
multi-condition `CheckSpec` — a compliance-engine contract change belonging to a
rules phase with its own ADR. No corpus device uses `exec-timeout 0 0`, so no
current measurement depends on the defect either way.

| 0023 | P14 | This document | — |

---

## 11. The interface

`ui/` is a React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind application, and a **pure
consumer**. It never evaluates a rule, computes a verdict, scores exposure, ranks
a finding or compares a baseline. Every number it shows was returned by the API
or is a count of rows the API returned.

Three levels of zoom, one question each: **fleet** (which devices need
attention) → **device** (what is wrong with this one) → **finding** (why do you
claim that, and what do I type). The training screen is the deliberate exception
— spacious, one line at a time, because a cramped training screen produces
careless confirmations and a careless confirmation enters a vendor pack
permanently.

`docs/ui_reference.html` is the visual specification. It contains **illustrative**
framework identifiers, compliance percentages and remediation commands that exist
to show a designer what the interface should look like. The application ships its
structure and none of its data, and frontend tests assert that none of those
values appears in the rendered document.

Role checks in the interface are **UX controls, not security**. The backend
refuses independently: admin endpoints answer 403, and a resource belonging to
another user answers 404 rather than 403, so an unauthorised caller learns nothing
about which identifiers exist.

*Prefer a small auditable claim over a large unverified one. An honest UNKNOWN is
a result; a guessed PASS is a liability.*
